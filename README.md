# BulkStructure

## Organises your picture library
#### I take no responsibility for any lost files, use at your own risk
A basic utility to sort your picture library into folders by year by extracting info from the file name (not metadata, use a program like Bulk Rename Utility to rename picture).
Works with all file types, not just pictures (anything with numbers in the name really).
Can do multiple files at once. Automatically creates Year folders in destination directory (Years 1900 - 2099 accounted for). WARNING: Deletes all empty directories in destination folder.
If file name is longer than in Step 3, it will be moved to ```Destination Directory\Other```
